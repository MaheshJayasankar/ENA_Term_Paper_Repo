# ENA Term Paper Repo

The repository contains the source code used for the Term Paper on Effects of Strong Ties on Employment in Labor Markets. The NetworksSourceCode.ipynb file contains the Jupyter Notebook, imported from Google Colab, which was used for generating the code. The Pickle Files directory contains .pkl files which contain the data pertaining to our simulated results. It is loaded in the relevant Plotting sections of the notebook. The Plots directory contains the generated plots, which were used in the paper.

In the process of running the notebook code, the relevant plots and data are generated, however, the notebook's modular design is intended to be able to run different sections piece-wise and analyse them separately.

To use the notebook:
1. Run the Initialization section of codes, to define all the classes and functions used.
2. In the Example Script section, various commands and parameters that can be used to generate output are given.
3. By defining the objects of classes Network, Simulator and Plotter, and through use of their inbuilt functions, the networks may be studied.
